            Yes, of course. You can spread the word about the apps or give good feedback and ratings. You can also help by translating the apps in a new language, or just update some existing translations.
            The guide to translating is at <a href="https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/General-Discussion#how-can-i-suggest-an-edit-to-a-file">this website</a>, or just contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@simplemobiletools.com">hello@simplemobiletools.com</a> if you have any questions.

    <string name="faq_6_title_commons">The app launcher icon disappeared. What can I do?</string>
    <string name="faq_6_text_commons">It is caused by your launcher not supporting icon customization properly. Try launching the app via Google Play or some widget, if available.
        Once launched, just set back the default orange icon #F57C00. You might have to reinstall the app in the worst case.</string>
    <string name="faq_7_title_commons">The money has been deducted from my bank account, but I cannot download the app. What can I do?</string>
    <string name="faq_7_text_commons">Payments are fully handled by Google, their system glitches from time to time. Just clear your Google Play app cache and restart your device, then retry downloading it.</string>
    <!-- FAQ -->
    <string name="faq_1_title">How can I change the widgets color?</string>
    <string name="faq_1_text">In case you have only 1 active widget, you can either recreate it, or use the button in the app settings for customizing it. If you have multiple active widgets, the button in the app settings will not be available. As the app supports color customization per-widget, you will have to recreate the widget that you want to customize.</string>

    <string name="faq_10_title_commons">I have purchased the app, but I cannot download it on another device.</string>
    <string name="faq_10_text_commons">Try clearing your Google Play app cache and restarting your device. It is some Google Play glitch, not really related to the app itself.</string>
